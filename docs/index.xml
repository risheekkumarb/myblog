<p>You’ve spent hours tuning your agentic pipeline. The system prompt is 500 words of carefully crafted instructions. It works… 70% of the time. You have 50 labeled examples. Now what?</p>
<p>Fine-tuning requires thousands of samples. Reinforcement learning needs expensive rollout collection. Manual prompt iteration doesn’t scale. You’re stuck.</p>
<p>But what if you could match RL’s optimization performance using 50 examples instead of 5,000?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457">GEPA</a></strong> (Genetic-Pareto) achieves exactly this—by exploiting something traditional optimization ignores: the rich textual traces that LLM systems already produce. Instead of reducing a complex trajectory to a single scalar reward, GEPA lets the LLM <em>reflect on its own failures</em> and propose improvements directly.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll unpack how it works, why modern LLMs’ improving self-reflection capabilities make this approach newly viable, and what it means for practitioners building compound AI systems.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-scalar-rewards-and-expensive-rollouts">The Problem: Scalar Rewards and Expensive Rollouts</h3>
<p>Traditional AI optimization techniques—reinforcement learning and fine-tuning—have achieved remarkable results in domains with abundant data or cheap rollouts (complete execution traces from input to output). But what happens when evaluation is expensive?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agentic pipelines</strong> that invoke simulations, query rate-limited APIs, or run multi-step tool chains</li>
<li><strong>Code generation for novel hardware</strong>, where each evaluation requires compiling for custom silicon and executing on the device</li>
<li><strong>Complex reasoning tasks</strong> with expensive verification steps</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting thousands of rollouts simply isn’t feasible in these settings.</p>
<p>The core issue: <strong>RL learns by comparison</strong>. A 500-step trajectory collapses to <code>reward = 0.73</code>. Did step 12 fail? Was the reasoning sound but the final answer malformed? The scalar tells you nothing. To extract signal, RL must compare many trajectories—<em>this one scored 0.8, that one scored 0.4, what differed?</em>—requiring sample counts that expensive domains can’t support.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>RL and fine-tuning require generating large amounts of rollouts to gather scalar learning signals—sample inefficient by design.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When each rollout costs minutes (or dollars), this approach breaks down.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-insight-llm-pipelines-generate-rich-textual-traces">The Insight: LLM Pipelines Generate Rich Textual Traces</h3>
<p>Modern AI systems built around LLMs are fundamentally different from traditional ML pipelines. At every step of execution, they produce natural language artifacts that traditional optimization simply discards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reasoning traces</strong> — Chain-of-Thought and ReAct logs expose the model’s explicit thought process. When a multi-hop QA system fails, you can see <em>where</em> the reasoning went wrong: “The capital of France is Paris. Paris is in Germany…” The failure mode is visible in the text.</li>
<li><strong>Environment feedback</strong> — Compiler errors don’t just say “failed.” They say <code>cannot find symbol 'x', did you mean 'y'?</code> API responses return structured explanations. Profilers report exactly which function consumed 80% of runtime.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation rubrics</strong> — LLM-as-judge systems don’t just score 3/5. They explain: “Response was accurate but exceeded the 200-word limit. Missing the requested bullet-point format. Tone too formal for the specified Slack context.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is dramatically richer than <code>reward = 0.73</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The key realization</strong>: these traces aren’t just logs for debugging—they’re potential <em>input to the optimizer</em>. A compiler error that says “did you mean ‘y’?” contains the fix. A rubric that says “too verbose” specifies exactly what to change.</p>
<p>Traditional RL ignores all of this. It reduces the entire trajectory to a scalar, then tries to reconstruct what went wrong by comparing thousands of trajectories.</p>
<p>But what if we could just… read the feedback?</p>
<p>This is the opportunity GEPA exploits. The question becomes: can an LLM reflect on these traces and propose improvements directly?</p>
</section>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-opportunity-llms-can-reflect-on-their-own-failures">The Opportunity: LLMs Can Reflect on Their Own Failures</h3>
<p>Here’s the key insight enabling a new optimization paradigm: <strong>LLMs already have prior knowledge about the domains they’re working in, and they’re increasingly capable of self-reflection.</strong></p>
<p>Consider what happens with different types of feedback:</p>
<p><strong>Compiler errors</strong> — When the compiler returns <code>cannot find symbol 'x', did you mean 'y'?</code>, the LLM doesn’t need thousands of examples to learn the fix. It already knows the library’s API. One error message is enough.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“The language model already knows that x is not a valid API name in the library but y is. Next time I should try this.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LLM-as-judge feedback</strong> — When a judge says “your summary was accurate but exceeded the 200-word limit and used overly formal tone for Slack,” the model can directly incorporate “be concise, match casual tone” into its next attempt. No statistical signal extraction required.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning trace failures</strong> — When a multi-hop QA trace shows the model correctly retrieved “Paris is the capital of France” but then hallucinated “Paris is in Germany,” the failure point is <em>visible in the text</em>. You can see exactly where the reasoning derailed.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy-aware rewriting (PUPA task)</strong> — In the paper’s experiments, an LLM must rewrite prompts to remove private information while preserving response quality. The LLM-as-judge explains <em>why</em> a rewrite failed—“leaked the user’s company name” or “removed too much context, degrading response quality”—giving the optimizer actionable signal from each example.</p>
<section id="the-core-asymmetry" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-core-asymmetry">The Core Asymmetry</h4>
<p>This is the fundamental difference GEPA exploits:</p>

<p>RL would need hundreds of rollouts to statistically isolate that <code>x→y</code> is the fix. The LLM gets it from one error message.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-fixes-to-generalizable-rules" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-fixes-to-generalizable-rules">From Fixes to Generalizable Rules</h4>
<p>Better still, modern LLMs don’t just extract point fixes—they can derive <em>generalizable lessons</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not just “use <code>y</code> instead of <code>x</code>” → but “always verify symbol names against the library’s namespace before generating code”</li>
<li>Not just “response was too long” → but “for Slack contexts, limit responses to 150 words and use bullet points”</li>
<li>Not just “leaked company name” → but “scan for proper nouns and replace with generic placeholders”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“LLMs can reflect on their own entire trajectories and extract lessons or generalizable rules that can be incorporated into the prompt.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These rules get folded directly into the prompt as instructions—compounding improvements across examples rather than treating each failure in isolation.</p>
<p>This capability unlock—LLMs that can genuinely reflect and generalize—is what makes GEPA viable now when it wouldn’t have been two years ago.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="why-now-the-reflection-capability-unlock" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-now-the-reflection-capability-unlock">Why Now? The Reflection Capability Unlock</h3>
<p>This approach wasn’t viable with earlier LLMs. In March 2023, roboticist <a href="https://evjang.com/2023/03/26/self-reflection.html">Eric Jang observed</a> that self-reflection capability “seems to be emergent in GPT-4 but not GPT-3.5 or Claude.” When asked to write a non-rhyming poem, GPT-4 produced rhymes—but when prompted “did the poem meet the assignment?” it apologized and corrected itself. GPT-3.5 and Claude couldn’t recognize their errors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366">Reflexion paper</a> (NeurIPS 2023) demonstrated the impact quantitatively: by maintaining verbal reflections across trials, LLMs achieved 91% on HumanEval coding benchmark versus GPT-4’s baseline 80%—without any weight updates. Similarly, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651">Self-Refine</a> showed ~20% average improvement by having the same LLM generate, critique, and refine iteratively.</p>
<p>But there’s a crucial nuance. A <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.tacl-1.78/">comprehensive 2024 survey</a> found that pure “intrinsic” self-correction—where the LLM reflects with no external signal—rarely helps, and can even degrade performance. What <em>does</em> work is self-correction with <strong>reliable external feedback</strong>: compiler errors, test results, structured rubrics.</p>
<p>This is precisely what GEPA exploits. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738">CRITIC paper</a> (ICLR 2024) highlights that external feedback is “crucial” for successful self-improvement. GEPA doesn’t ask the LLM to magically know it was wrong. It feeds the LLM rich textual feedback—the compiler said this, the profiler showed that, the judge flagged this rubric—and asks it to reflect on <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>The capability unlock isn’t “LLMs can now introspect perfectly.” It’s “LLMs can now <em>process feedback and generalize lessons</em> effectively.”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“Earlier LLMs could not actually reflect that well on their trajectories and extract meaningful insights or lessons… But now we are seeing that as LLMs are getting better they can also reflect on their own entire trajectories and extract lessons that can be incorporated into the prompt.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bootstrap-few-shot-dspy-2023">Bootstrap Few-Shot (DSPy, 2023)</h4>
<p>The original insight: you don’t need hand-crafted demonstrations. Given a task and metric, run the pipeline on your training examples, score the outputs, and keep the high-scoring (input, output) pairs as <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot">few-shot demonstrations</a> for future runs. The system bootstraps its own examples from successful executions.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Your QA system correctly answers “What’s the capital of France?” → “Paris”. That (question, answer) pair becomes a demonstration shown to the model on future queries.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: Demonstrations are static snapshots. Once selected, they don’t adapt when new failure modes emerge. And there’s no instruction optimization — the system prompt stays identical whether you’re handling edge cases or common inputs.</p>

<section id="opro-google-deepmind-2023" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="opro-google-deepmind-2023">OPRO (Google DeepMind, 2023)</h4>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409">OPRO</a> (Optimization by PROmpting, NeurIPS 2023) introduced the idea of using an LLM as the optimizer itself. The key mechanism: show the LLM a history of prompts and their scores, then ask it to propose a better one. Higher-scoring prompts appear more frequently in this history, nudging the LLM toward successful patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: The optimizer sees:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"Solve the math problem step by step"</code> → score 0.65</li>
<li><code>"Show your work and verify the answer"</code> → score 0.72</li>
<li><code>"Break the problem into cases and check each"</code> → score 0.78</li>
</ul>
<p>It proposes: <code>"Systematically enumerate cases and verify each solution"</code> → score 0.81</p>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: Score-only signal. The optimizer sees <em>that</em> <code>prompt_v3</code> scored 0.72 but not <em>why</em>. Did it make algebraic errors? Miss edge cases? The number alone doesn’t say.</p>
</section>
<section id="mipro-2024" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mipro-2024">MiPRO (2024)</h4>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11695">MiPRO</a> recognized that instructions and demonstrations interact—the <em>same</em> instruction performs differently with different example sets. The best instruction with bad demos might score worse than a mediocre instruction with perfect demos.</p>
<p><strong>The search space problem</strong>: Say you have 10 candidate instructions and 5 possible demo sets. That’s 50 combinations. Now add instruction variants (“Be concise” vs “Be brief” vs “Answer in one sentence”)—suddenly you have hundreds of candidates. Each full evaluation means running your pipeline on your entire dev set. At $0.10 per run with 100 dev examples, evaluating all 500 combinations costs $5,000. Not feasible.</p>
<p><strong>MiPRO’s solution: a cheap surrogate model</strong>. Instead of running the full pipeline, MiPRO trains a small predictor (think: logistic regression) on the evaluations you <em>have</em> run. The predictor learns patterns like “instructions mentioning ‘step-by-step’ tend to score higher” or “demos with longer reasoning traces correlate with better performance.”</p>
<p>The workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Bootstrap</strong>: Run a small random sample of combinations (say, 30 out of 500)</li>
<li><strong>Train surrogate</strong>: Fit the predictor on those 30 (instruction, demos) → score pairs</li>
<li><strong>Predict cheaply</strong>: Score all 500 combinations using the surrogate (milliseconds, not dollars)</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate selectively</strong>: Only run full evaluation on the top-predicted candidates</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>: Add new results to training data, retrain surrogate, sample again</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: After 30 random evaluations, the surrogate learns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructions with “step-by-step” → +0.08 average</li>
<li>Demo set B (which has chain-of-thought examples) → +0.05 average</li>
<li>Combining both → predicted 0.79</li>
</ul>
<p>MiPRO focuses budget on high-predicted combinations rather than exhaustive search.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: The surrogate learns <em>correlations</em>, not <em>causation</em>. It knows “step-by-step instructions score higher” but not <em>why</em>—maybe they help on math problems but hurt on simple lookups. And MiPRO optimizes for aggregate score: a prompt that’s 0.75 on everything beats one that’s 0.95 on hard cases but 0.60 overall—even though that hard-case specialist might contain crucial insights.</p>
</section>
<section id="simba-dspy-2024" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simba-dspy-2024">SIMBA (DSPy, 2024)</h4>
<p><a href="https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/SIMBA/">SIMBA</a> (Stochastic Introspective Mini-Batch Ascent) introduced self-reflection into prompt optimization. Rather than treating prompts as black boxes with hidden payout rates, SIMBA has the LLM analyze its own performance and propose improvements.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Sample mini-batches</strong>: Instead of evaluating on the full dataset, SIMBA samples small batches of examples</li>
<li><strong>Identify hard cases</strong>: Track which examples show high output variability or consistent failures</li>
<li><strong>Generate reflective rules</strong>: Ask the LLM to analyze why those cases failed and propose improvement rules</li>
<li><strong>Update prompts</strong>: Incorporate the rules as new instructions, or add successful examples as demonstrations</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>: Iterate with new mini-batches, accumulating insights</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: After several mini-batches, SIMBA notices examples 7 and 12 consistently fail. It prompts the LLM: “These examples failed. What pattern do you see?” The LLM reflects: “Both involve multi-step calculations where I lost track of units.” SIMBA adds: “Always track units through each calculation step.”</p>
<p><strong>The key innovation</strong>: SIMBA bridges the gap between score-only optimization (OPRO, MiPRO) and full trajectory reflection (GEPA). It uses introspection on failure patterns rather than just comparing aggregate scores.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: SIMBA’s reflection is still relatively shallow—it identifies patterns across examples but doesn’t deeply analyze individual execution traces. GEPA extends this by feeding the optimizer rich textual feedback (compiler errors, rubrics, reasoning traces) from each trajectory.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gepa-2025-the-reflection-shift">GEPA (2025): The Reflection Shift</h4>
<p>GEPA breaks from this trajectory in two fundamental ways:</p>

<td>“Exceeded word limit. Missing keyword. Compiler error: use y not x.”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Selection strategy</strong></td>
<td>Best aggregate score</td>
<td>Pareto frontier of diverse specialists</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>1. From scalar scores to textual feedback</strong> — Instead of just knowing <em>that</em> a prompt scored 0.6, GEPA sees <em>why</em>: the compiler error, the rubric failures, the reasoning trace where hallucination occurred. The optimizer reads the feedback directly.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: OPRO sees <code>score = 0.6</code>. GEPA sees: &gt; “Failed on example 7: response was 340 words (limit: 200). Failed on example 12: missing required keyword ‘disclaimer’. Passed examples 1-6, 8-11.”</p>
<p>The LLM reflects: “I should add an instruction about word limits and required keywords.”</p>
<p><strong>2. From greedy to Pareto selection</strong> — Instead of always promoting the highest-scoring candidate, GEPA maintains a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto frontier</a></em>: candidates that each excel at <em>something</em> no other candidate beats.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Three candidates evaluated on 10 examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>prompt_A</code>: 8/10 overall, but fails hard cases #7 and #9</li>
<li><code>prompt_B</code>: 6/10 overall, but nails hard cases #7 and #9<br>
</li>
<li><code>prompt_C</code>: 7/10 overall, no unique strengths</li>
</ul>
<p>Greedy selection keeps only <code>prompt_A</code>. Pareto selection keeps both <code>prompt_A</code> <em>and</em> <code>prompt_B</code>—because B’s insights about hard cases might combine with A’s general strength. <code>prompt_C</code> gets dropped (dominated by A on everything).</p>
<p>The contrast with prior optimizers is stark: OPRO knows the score dropped from 0.8 to 0.6. GEPA reads the compiler error that explains why—and proposes the fix directly.</p>

<p>We’ll build them from scratch in this section:</p>

<p>The rest of this section explains <em>why</em> each of these pieces matters and how they work together. If you just want to use GEPA, the code above is all you need—see the <a href="https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/GEPA/overview/">DSPy GEPA API Reference</a> for full parameter details.</p>
<p>Now let’s make this concrete by building the core mechanism from scratch.</p>

<p>The diagram above shows how these pieces fit together. Starting from the candidate pool (left), GEPA evaluates each prompt on every training task to build a per-instance scores matrix. Pareto filtering then preserves prompts that excel at <em>something</em>—not just the highest aggregate scorer. New candidates emerge either through <strong>reflective mutation</strong> (learning from textual feedback on a minibatch) or <strong>merge</strong> (combining insights from two specialists). Only candidates that pass a cheap minibatch screening get full evaluation.</p>
<p>Let’s now build the core mechanism—reflective mutation—from scratch to see exactly how the “Reflect and Propose New Prompt” step works.</p>

<p><strong>Why AIME for testing prompt optimization?</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Clear ground truth</strong> — Every answer is an integer (0-999), so evaluation is unambiguous</li>
<li><strong>Rich failure modes</strong> — Wrong answers come from algebraic errors, missed cases, misread constraints</li>
<li><strong>Domain knowledge helps</strong> — Prompts that encode strategies (“subtract equations pairwise”, “enumerate all cases”) measurably improve performance</li>
<li><strong>Small dataset</strong> — Only 90 problems, so sample efficiency matters</li>

<p><strong>Example filled-in reflection prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>I provided an assistant with the following instructions:
&lt;curr_instructions&gt;
You are given a problem and you have to give the answer along with reasoning. 
Do not return anything apart from json. It should be parsable by json.loads()

The following are examples with assistant's responses and feedback:
&lt;inputs_outputs_feedback&gt;
# Example 1
## problem
Quadratic polynomials P(x) and Q(x) have leading coefficient 1. The sum of the roots of P(x) is 7...
## prediction
{"answer": 42, "reasoning": "I solved the system and got x=7, y=6"}
## feedback
You got it wrong! The solution is 116

# Example 2
## problem
Three spheres with radii 11, 13, and 19 are mutually externally tangent...
## prediction
{"answer": 756, "reasoning": "Using the tangent sphere formula..."}
## feedback
You got it right!

# Example 3
## problem
Find the remainder when 2^2024 is divided by 1000...
## prediction
{"answer": 16, "reasoning": "I computed powers of 2 mod 1000..."}
## feedback
You got it wrong! The solution is 896

Your task: write a new instruction for the assistant.

- Read inputs carefully and identify the input format and task description
- Read all responses and feedback. Identify niche/domain-specific factual information
- If the assistant used a generalizable strategy, include that in the instruction

Provide the new instructions.</code></pre>

</table>
<p><strong>The good</strong>: Iteration 2 extracted genuinely useful domain knowledge. Despite 0% minibatch accuracy, the reflection LLM identified patterns from the problems themselves and added this to the prompt:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“When dealing with systems of equations like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?xy%20+%20Az%20=%20C">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?yz%20+%20Ax%20=%20C">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?zx%20+%20Ay%20=%20C">, consider subtracting equations pairwise to find relationships between variables, such as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(x-z)(y-A)=0">, which implies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x=z"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y=A">. Systematically explore all such cases.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is directly from the actual output—the reflection LLM read the failed attempt on a systems-of-equations problem and generalized a useful heuristic.</p>
<p><strong>The bad</strong>: Iteration 3 achieved 67% on its minibatch but dropped to <strong>10% validation</strong>. Why? The minibatch happened to contain number theory problems, so the reflection added specialized number-theory guidance:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“When the problem involves number theory and remainders (e.g., <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Cpmod%20x">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%5Cpmod%20y">), pay close attention to inconsistencies or contradictions that might arise from given conditions, especially when distinct remainders are required, as these can lead to an answer of 0.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This over-specialized advice (“can lead to an answer of 0”) actively hurt performance on non-number-theory problems, dropping validation from 30% back to <strong>10%</strong> (1/10)—though notably, it did solve problem #9, which earlier prompts couldn’t.</p>

<section id="the-greedy-selection-problem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-greedy-selection-problem">The Greedy Selection Problem</h3>
<p>This demonstrates exactly why GEPA uses <strong>Pareto selection</strong> instead of always taking the “best” prompt:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Iteration 2’s prompt</strong> was a specialist—it learned something valuable about systems of equations</li>
<li><strong>Iteration 3</strong> tried to improve on iteration 2, but the minibatch had different problems</li>
<li>The reflection <strong>overwrote</strong> the systems-of-equations insight while adding number-theory tips that were <em>too specific</em></li>
<li>Result: <strong>catastrophic forgetting</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With greedy selection, we would have discarded iteration 2’s valuable insight. Pareto selection would keep it—because it was <em>best on at least one validation instance</em>.</p>

Let R(x)=P(x)+Q(x). Since the x²-terms of P and Q have leading coefficient 1, 
R(x) is quadratic with leading coefficient 2. Given the roots condition, we can 
write R(x) = 2(x-r₁)(x-r₂). Expanding and comparing coefficients...</code></pre>
<p>With rich feedback, the reflection LLM can extract <em>specific strategies</em> from the expert solution rather than having to guess what went wrong. This is the key insight from the GEPA paper: <strong>the feedback contains the fix</strong>.</p>
<p>Compare this to RL, which would only see <code>reward = 0</code> and have to statistically infer what went wrong across thousands of trajectories.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Reflective mutation works</strong> — Even with minimal feedback, the LLM extracted useful domain knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Greedy selection fails</strong> — Iteration 3’s collapse shows why we need to preserve specialist insights</li>
<li><strong>Feedback quality matters</strong> — Rich feedback (expert solutions, compiler errors, rubric explanations) gives the reflection LLM more to work with</li>
<li><strong>Sample efficiency is real</strong> — We saw meaningful optimization with just 3 iterations on 3 examples each</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the core limitation of greedy optimization: <strong>catastrophic forgetting</strong>. The solution? Pareto selection—which we’ll build from scratch next.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hands-on-building-the-pareto-frontier">Hands-On: Building the Pareto Frontier</h3>
<p>In the reflective mutation section, we saw greedy selection fail—iteration 3’s over-specialized prompt dropped validation from 30% to 10%, losing iteration 2’s valuable systems-of-equations insights. The fundamental problem: always improving your “best” prompt discards specialist knowledge.</p>
<p>GEPA’s solution: <strong>Pareto selection</strong>. Instead of keeping one best prompt, maintain a <em>frontier</em> of prompts where each excels at something no other prompt beats.</p>

<section id="what-is-pareto-dominance" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-pareto-dominance">What is Pareto Dominance?</h4>
<p>A prompt <strong>dominates</strong> another if it’s at least as good everywhere, and strictly better somewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>≥</strong> on <em>every</em> validation instance, AND<br>
</li>
<li><strong>&gt;</strong> on <em>at least one</em> instance</li>
</ul>
<p>If prompt A dominates prompt B, we can safely discard B—A is strictly better in every way that matters. But if neither dominates the other (each wins on different instances), both belong on the frontier.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider four prompts evaluated on 10 validation instances. We’ll use labels P0-P3, which map to our earlier experiment: P0 = Seed, P1 = Iteration 1, P2 = Iteration 2, P3 = Iteration 3:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Prompt</th>
<th>Instances Solved</th>
<th>Aggregate</th>
<th>Status</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>P0 (seed)</td>
<td>#0 only</td>
<td>10%</td>
<td>Dominated by P2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>P1 (iter 1)</td>
<td>#0 only</td>
<td>10%</td>
<td>Dominated by P2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>P2 (iter 2)</td>
<td>#0, #1, #2</td>
<td>30%</td>
<td><strong>Frontier</strong> ✓</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>P3 (iter 3)</td>
<td>#9 only</td>
<td>10%</td>
<td><strong>Frontier</strong> ✓</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>P2 dominates both P0 and P1—it solves everything they solve, plus more. But P3 survives despite its low aggregate score! It solved instance #9, which <em>nothing else could</em>.</p>
<p>The Pareto frontier is <strong>{P2, P3}</strong>. Both contain unique value.</p>

<p>Our final frontier: <strong>{P2, P3}</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>P2: Strong generalist (30%), knows systems-of-equations strategies</li>
<li>P3: Instance-9 specialist (10%), knows whatever cracked that specific problem</li>

<p>Greedy selection caused our iteration 3 collapse—the number-theory prompt overwrote the algebra prompt’s insights. Pareto selection prevents this by construction: you can’t remove a prompt from the frontier unless something else does everything it does, <em>plus more</em>.</p>
<p>This is the core of GEPA’s sample efficiency. Instead of needing thousands of examples to statistically rediscover lost insights, the frontier <strong>never loses them in the first place</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>We just saw Pareto selection preserve iteration 3’s prompt despite its 10% aggregate score—because it solved instance #9, which nothing else could. But this raises a question: <em>why</em> does keeping “losers” help optimization? Shouldn’t we focus resources on the best candidates?</p>
<p>The answer comes from <strong>quality-diversity</strong> algorithms, a family of techniques from evolutionary computation that GEPA draws from directly.</p>
</section>

<section id="why-pareto-works-quality-diversity-and-map-elites" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-pareto-works-quality-diversity-and-map-elites">Why Pareto Works: Quality-Diversity and Map Elites</h3>
<p>We’ve now built both core mechanisms from scratch—reflective mutation and Pareto selection. Before diving into the full algorithm, let’s briefly step back and understand <em>why</em> this approach works so well.</p>
<p>The Pareto frontier isn’t a novel invention—it draws from <strong>quality-diversity (QD)</strong> algorithms, a family of techniques from evolutionary computation that have proven remarkably effective in domains where diversity itself is valuable.</p>
<section id="the-core-insight" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-core-insight">The Core Insight</h4>
<p>Traditional optimization asks: <em>“What’s the single best solution?”</em></p>
<p>Quality-diversity asks: <em>“What’s the best solution of each <em>type</em>?”</em></p>
<p>Complex problems often have multiple valid approaches. A chess engine that always plays aggressively might beat one that always plays defensively—but the best engine knows <em>both</em> styles and picks situationally. Maintaining diverse specialists, then combining their insights, outperforms converging prematurely on one “best” approach.</p>
</section>
<section id="map-elites-the-inspiration" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="map-elites-the-inspiration">Map Elites: The Inspiration</h4>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909">Map Elites</a> (Mouret &amp; Clune, 2015) maintains an <em>archive</em> organized by behavior:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Define behavior dimensions</strong> — characteristics describing <em>how</em> a solution works (not just how well)</li>
<li><strong>Discretize into bins</strong> — each cell represents a “niche”</li>
<li><strong>Keep the best per bin</strong> — new solutions compete only within their niche</li>
<li><strong>Mutate from the archive</strong> — sample from any occupied bin, mutate, place in appropriate bin</li>
</ol>
<p>The result: diverse specialists, each optimal <em>of its type</em>. <strong>Key insight</strong>: the archive provides <em>stepping stones</em>—a mutation from one niche might discover something useful for another. Diversity isn’t just nice to have; it’s a search strategy.</p>

<section id="gepas-adaptation-validation-instances-as-niches" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gepas-adaptation-validation-instances-as-niches">GEPA’s Adaptation: Validation Instances as Niches</h4>
<p>GEPA recognizes that <strong>the validation set itself defines the behavior space</strong>:</p>

<p>Each validation instance encodes what domain-specific insights are required. A prompt solving only instance #7 is the “specialist for that niche”—it stays because it demonstrates <em>something works</em>, even with low aggregate score.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“By tracking the best-performing candidate on each validation instance, GEPA can maintain all the domain-specific insights that solve any of these problems.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This directly motivated GEPA’s design: Pareto selection over per-instance scores naturally implements QD’s “best per niche” principle, while the merge operation recombines insights across niches—exactly what stepping-stone search requires.</p>
<p>With both mechanisms in place, there’s one more operation that makes GEPA powerful: <strong>merge</strong>—combining insights from divergent lineages.</p>

<p>Pareto selection preserves specialists—but it creates a new problem: <strong>insights get siloed in separate branches</strong>.</p>

<p>The P2→P4 lineage accumulated <strong>algebra insights</strong>. The P3→P5 lineage accumulated <strong>number theory insights</strong>. Both survive on the Pareto frontier because each solves problems the other can’t.</p>
<p>But what about a problem requiring <em>both</em>?</p>
<hr>
<section id="the-recombination-problem" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-recombination-problem">The Recombination Problem</h4>
<p>Suppose validation instance #7 needs algebraic manipulation to set up a system of equations, then modular arithmetic to constrain the solution space. Neither P4 nor P5 can solve it:</p>
<ul>
<li>P4 knows to subtract equations pairwise, but doesn’t think to reduce mod p</li>
<li>P5 knows CRT, but misses the algebraic setup</li>
</ul>
<p>With mutation alone, P4 would need to <em>independently rediscover</em> number theory (which P5 already knows), or vice versa. The knowledge exists in our population—just in different branches.</p>
<p><strong>Merge</strong> solves this by combining insights from divergent lineages into a single candidate.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-merge-works">How Merge Works</h4>
<p>GEPA’s merge is “system-aware”—the LLM understands what it’s combining, so it can resolve contradictions and synthesize coherently rather than blindly concatenating (unlike genetic algorithm crossover which swaps segments randomly). The reflection LLM receives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Both parent prompts</strong> with their full instruction text</li>
<li><strong>Lineage context</strong> — what types of problems each lineage solved</li>
<li><strong>Conflict guidance</strong> — instructions to resolve contradictions, not ignore them</li>
</ol>
<p>The prompt asks the LLM to <em>synthesize</em>, not concatenate:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Create a SINGLE unified instruction set that incorporates key insights from BOTH. Preserve specific strategies. Resolve contradictions thoughtfully. Don’t simply concatenate—synthesize into coherent guidance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Concrete example</strong> — merging our AIME specialists:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 22%">
<col style="width: 30%">
<col style="width: 47%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Parent</th>
<th>Specialty</th>
<th>Key instruction</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>P4</td>
<td>Algebra</td>
<td>“Subtract equations pairwise to expose (x-z)(y-A)=0. Enumerate all cases.”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>P5</td>
<td>Number theory</td>
<td>“Apply CRT for modular constraints. Check for contradictions.”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Merged offspring P6:</strong> &gt; “Approach: (1) For equation systems, subtract pairwise to expose factor relationships—enumerate all cases including edge cases. (2) When modular conditions appear, apply CRT and check for contradictions. (3) Competition problems often combine both: set up the algebra first, then use number-theoretic constraints to eliminate impossible cases.”</p>
<p>P6 inherits both toolkits AND adds <strong>meta-knowledge</strong> about when to combine them. This is the “system-aware” part—the merge understands the semantics of what it’s combining.</p>

<p>Random crossover might produce: “Subtract equations pairwise. Apply CRT. Subtract equations pairwise.” (nonsense duplication)</p>
<p>LLM merge produces: “Set up algebra first, then apply number-theoretic constraints.” (coherent synthesis)</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-compounding-effect">The Compounding Effect</h4>
<p>The components reinforce each other:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Pareto selection</strong> preserves the diversity that makes merge valuable</li>
<li><strong>Lineage tracking</strong> identifies which candidates come from divergent branches<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Merge</strong> recombines orthogonal discoveries into unified candidates</li>
<li><strong>Pareto selection</strong> then preserves successful merges alongside remaining specialists</li>
</ol>
<p>Without Pareto selection, there’s nothing interesting to merge—you’d just have variants of one “best” prompt. Without merge, insights stay siloed even when the frontier is diverse.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Implementation note</strong>: The full GEPA implementation includes safeguards to ensure merge candidates actually have different insights worth combining—checking for common ancestors, avoiding redundant merges, and verifying that descendants improved on their ancestor. See the <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy">DSPy source</a> for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mutation explores <em>depth</em>—refining one approach through successive reflections.<br>
Merge explores <em>breadth</em>—combining orthogonal discoveries from parallel paths.</p>
<p>Together, they cover the search space efficiently: diversify through mutation, consolidate through merge, preserve all valuable discoveries through Pareto selection.</p>
<p>With reflective mutation, Pareto selection, and merge all in place, here’s how they combine into GEPA’s full optimization loop.</p>

<p><strong>1. Candidate Sampling</strong> — Weighted by unique wins, so specialists get attention proportional to their unique value.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mutation vs Merge</strong> — Early iterations favor mutation; merge probability increases as frontier diversifies.</p>
<p><strong>3. Mini-Batch Gating</strong></p>
<p>Before expensive full evaluation, GEPA checks if the new candidate improves on the mini-batch it was designed to fix. This saves compute on obviously bad mutations:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“We propose one new candidate, do a mini-batch evaluation to see whether this new candidate improves on this mini-batch or not. And if it does improve, then we track the score for this new candidate on all validation instances.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Pareto Update</strong></p>
<p>The frontier update follows the dominance logic we implemented earlier: - <strong>Reject</strong> new candidates dominated by existing ones (they add nothing) - <strong>Remove</strong> existing candidates dominated by the new one (they’re obsolete) - <strong>Keep</strong> all non-dominated candidates (each offers unique value)</p>

<p>The mini-batch gate is crucial for efficiency. Most mutations fail—they either don’t improve on their target examples or regress elsewhere. Catching failures early (3 evaluations) rather than late (N evaluations) saves ~90% of evaluation budget on rejected candidates.</p>

<p>We’ve built the full algorithm—reflective mutation, Pareto selection, merge. But what does all this machinery actually <em>produce</em>? Let’s examine the output: prompts that encode domain expertise.</p>
<p>One of GEPA’s most striking capabilities is its ability to <strong>encode domain-specific knowledge directly into prompts</strong>—transforming tacit expertise into explicit instructions that persist across examples.</p>
<section id="prompts-as-knowledge-containers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompts-as-knowledge-containers">Prompts as Knowledge Containers</h4>
<p>Traditional optimization treats prompts as opaque strings to be scored. GEPA treats them as <strong>knowledge containers</strong> that accumulate insights through the reflection loop:</p>

<p>The prompt evolved from generic instruction to encoding <strong>competition math heuristics</strong>. The LLM didn’t invent these—it extracted them from its training knowledge, triggered by seeing specific failure modes.</p>
</section>
<section id="three-categories-of-captured-knowledge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="three-categories-of-captured-knowledge">Three Categories of Captured Knowledge</h4>
<p>We observe GEPA capturing different types of domain expertise (our interpretive taxonomy, not from the paper):</p>
<p><strong>1. Format and Interface Knowledge</strong> - Output schemas (“return JSON with keys: answer, reasoning”) - API conventions (“use library.method(), not library_method()”) - Parsing requirements (“integers only, no leading zeros”)</p>
<p>This is easiest to extract—format errors produce explicit feedback.</p>
<p><strong>2. Strategic Knowledge</strong> - Problem-solving heuristics (“try small cases first”) - Domain patterns (“competition problems often combine algebra and number theory”) - Failure mode awareness (“watch for off-by-one errors in counting”)</p>
<p>This emerges from reflecting on <em>why</em> approaches failed, not just <em>that</em> they failed.</p>
<p><strong>3. Factual Domain Knowledge</strong> - API names and signatures (“torch.einsum, not torch.einstein_sum”) - Domain constants (“standard gravity = 9.81 m/s²”) - Constraint relationships (“in valid Sudoku, each row/column/box contains 1-9 exactly once”)</p>
<p>The LLM already knows this—reflection surfaces it into the prompt where it’s consistently applied.</p>

<section id="the-preservation-problem" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-preservation-problem">The Preservation Problem</h4>
<p>Knowledge accumulation has a failure mode: <strong>new insights can overwrite old ones</strong>. We saw this in our hands-on experiment—iteration 3’s number theory insights overwrote iteration 2’s algebra insights, causing catastrophic forgetting.</p>
<p>This is precisely why GEPA uses <strong>Pareto selection</strong>. By preserving prompts that are best on <em>any</em> validation instance, Pareto ensures specialized knowledge survives even when aggregate scores dip. The algebra specialist and number theory specialist both stay on the frontier—and the merge operation can later combine their insights.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Without Pareto selection, GEPA would be a knowledge accumulator that periodically erases its own discoveries.</em></p>

</section>
<section id="limitation-knowledge-must-be-triggerable" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitation-knowledge-must-be-triggerable">Limitation: Knowledge Must Be Triggerable</h4>
<p>GEPA can only surface knowledge the base LLM already has—it extracts and organizes existing knowledge, not creates new knowledge. This is why it works better with stronger base models: more latent knowledge to extract. For highly specialized domains (custom hardware APIs, proprietary protocols), you may need human-curated seed instructions or few-shot examples to bootstrap the reflection loop.</p>
<hr>
<p>So far we’ve focused on <em>training</em>: optimize prompts on labeled examples, deploy the best one. But GEPA’s machinery—reflective mutation, Pareto selection, merge—can also be deployed at <em>inference time</em> as a search algorithm. This opens a second paradigm worth understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Train-then-generalize</strong> (what we’ve built so far):</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize prompts on a training set</li>
<li>Select the best-aggregate prompt from the Pareto frontier</li>
<li>Deploy that prompt on new, unseen tasks</li>
<li>Goal: learn <em>generalizable</em> lessons that transfer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Test-time search</strong> (inference-time optimization):</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a batch of hard tasks you need to solve <em>now</em></li>
<li>Optimize directly on the tasks themselves</li>
<li>GEPA searches for solutions, storing the best prompt <em>per task</em></li>
<li>Goal: maximize performance on <em>these specific instances</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The mechanics are identical—reflective mutation, Pareto selection, merge. What changes is the intent: instead of learning transferable knowledge, you’re using GEPA as a <strong>search algorithm</strong> over the solution space. This aligns with the broader trend of <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">inference-time compute scaling</a>—investing more computation at inference to solve harder problems.</p>
<p><strong>The key mechanical change</strong>: In normal GEPA, you have separate <code>trainset</code> (to learn from via reflection) and <code>valset</code> (to evaluate generalization). The Pareto frontier tracks per-instance performance on <code>valset</code>, preserving prompts that generalize well.</p>
<p>For test-time search, pass the <em>same</em> problems as both <code>trainset</code> and <code>valset</code>:</p>

<p>This tells GEPA: “I don’t care about generalization—optimize directly on <em>these specific problems</em>.” The Pareto frontier now tracks “best prompt for each problem” rather than “prompts that transfer to unseen data.” See the <a href="https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/GEPA/overview/">GEPA API documentation</a> for full parameter details.</p>

<section id="why-gepa-beats-high-temperature-sampling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-gepa-beats-high-temperature-sampling">Why GEPA Beats High-Temperature Sampling</h3>
<p>Traditional inference-time strategies sample at high temperature to generate many candidates, then pick the best. But these samples tend to be <em>similar</em>—variations on the same approach. GEPA induces <strong>genuine diversity</strong> through Pareto tracking (maintaining candidates that excel at <em>something different</em>) and reflective mutation (proposing <em>structurally different</em> strategies based on what went wrong, not random perturbations).</p>
<p>When feedback says “memory bandwidth bottleneck,” the next candidate might switch from a naive loop to shared-memory tiling—a qualitative change that temperature variation rarely discovers. On the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874">MATH benchmark</a>, this approach achieves <strong>93% accuracy</strong> compared to 67% with basic DSPy ChainOfThought.</p>

<section id="self-bootstrapping-at-inference" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="self-bootstrapping-at-inference">Self-Bootstrapping at inference</h3>
<p>During training, you iterate a fixed number of times and deploy the result. At inference time, you can keep iterating <em>on a single hard problem</em> until it’s solved—and GEPA’s reflective loop creates a self-bootstrapping dynamic:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Round 1</strong>: Generate rollout → compiler error (“undefined variable x”) → reflect → propose fix</li>
<li><strong>Round 2</strong>: Code compiles → runtime error (division by zero) → reflect → propose fix<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Round 3</strong>: Runtime works → wrong output (“expected 42, got 41”) → reflect → propose fix</li>
<li><strong>Round 4</strong>: Correct output ✓</li>
</ol>
<p>Each iteration surfaces <em>the next</em> failure mode—you can’t discover the runtime error until the compile error is fixed. Traditional sampling generates 100 candidates that all hit the same compiler error. GEPA’s iterative reflection <em>progresses through</em> the failure cascade.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“It identifies new challenges that the system is going to encounter as well as at every step it is going to propose a solution to that challenge. So it’s kind of like self-bootstrapping data to train itself.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why test-time GEPA can solve problems that stumped training: it has the budget to chase failure modes deeper than any fixed training run.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When optimizing a batch of tasks, Pareto selection ensures that fixing one problem doesn’t discard prompts that solved others—see “Cross-Task Transfer Within a Batch” below.</p>

<section id="background-optimization-loops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background-optimization-loops">Background Optimization Loops</h3>
<p>The self-bootstrapping pattern suggests an intriguing application: <strong>background GEPA loops for personalization</strong> in tools like Cursor and other AI-assisted environments.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“For your cursor agent use case, I can imagine that there can be a background GEPA loop that runs continuously and every time you give it feedback, it iterates and generates a new generalizing prompt… cursor can learn a user-specific prompt that works well specifically for you.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every correction you provide—rejecting a verbose explanation, fixing a code style—becomes a training signal that accumulates into a personalized prompt. The infrastructure isn’t widespread yet, but the pattern is clear: continuous adaptation rather than one-shot optimization.</p>

<section id="what-gepa-stores" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-gepa-stores">What GEPA Stores</h3>
<p>For each task in the batch, GEPA tracks both artifacts:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“GEPA tracks the best prompt per test case and you can store both the prompt as well as the output generated by that prompt.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best outputs</strong> — the actual solutions, ready to use</li>
<li><strong>Best prompts</strong> — specialized strategies representing different subdomains of your problem space</li>
</ul>
<p>You can deploy these domain-specific prompts for future similar tasks, or simply extract the outputs and move on.</p>
<hr>
<p>When the conditions <em>are</em> right—rich feedback, high-value tasks worth the compute, domains where the LLM has strong priors—test-time GEPA can dramatically outperform sampling-based approaches. The next section demonstrates this on code generation: GEPA-optimized CUDA kernels that exceed human-written PyTorch baselines, in a domain where even frontier models like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 match the baseline on less than 20% of tasks.</p>

<p>The GEPA paper demonstrates test-time search on domains where GEPA’s strengths shine brightest: <strong>code optimization for hardware with limited pre-training data</strong>.</p>
<section id="amd-npu-kernels-optimization-without-pre-training-knowledge" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="amd-npu-kernels-optimization-without-pre-training-knowledge">AMD NPU Kernels: Optimization Without Pre-Training Knowledge</h4>
<p>AMD’s NPU (Neural Processing Unit) represents a novel hardware architecture. LLMs have minimal pre-training knowledge about its programming model, memory hierarchy, or optimization patterns. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14403">NPUEval benchmark</a> reveals just how challenging this is: even with compiler feedback and RAG, state-of-the-art LLMs achieve only ~10% mean vectorization score.</p>
<p>GEPA’s approach doesn’t require prior examples—it iteratively generates kernels, receives compiler errors or performance metrics, reflects on feedback, and proposes targeted improvements. The compiler error messages contain the fix: “Symbol not found: <code>npu_matmul</code>” triggers reflection that surfaces the correct API.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<section id="cuda-kernels-outperforming-human-baselines" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cuda-kernels-outperforming-human-baselines">CUDA Kernels: Outperforming Human Baselines</h4>
<p><a href="https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/blogs/kernelbench/">KernelBench</a> (Stanford, 2025) evaluates LLMs on generating efficient CUDA kernels. The benchmark reveals a sobering baseline: <strong>frontier reasoning models match the PyTorch baseline on less than 20% of tasks</strong> using the fast₁ metric (correct <em>and</em> faster than PyTorch). Efficient GPU programming requires optimization patterns (memory coalescing, shared memory tiling, warp-level primitives) that models haven’t learned to apply reliably.</p>
<p>The KernelBench paper shows that feedback-driven refinement dramatically improves results—fast₁ scores jumped 3-6x when execution results and profiler feedback were provided in context. GEPA applies this same principle systematically, with Pareto tracking to preserve diverse optimization strategies rather than ad-hoc iteration.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“For CUDA we show results on KernelBench where GEPA was able to generate better kernels, sometimes even outperforming the PyTorch baseline which are human-written.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The self-bootstrapping dynamic is especially effective here: each compilation error or profiler bottleneck reveals the next fix, letting GEPA progress through failure cascades that stump one-shot sampling.</p>
</section>
<section id="cross-kernel-transfer" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-kernel-transfer">Cross-Kernel Transfer</h4>
<p>When optimizing a batch of related kernels, insights compound across tasks:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“If I discover an insight that works well on task one, there is a high possibility that it will also work well on task two.”</em> — Lakshya A Agrawal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As GEPA optimizes each kernel, the Pareto frontier accumulates specialized prompts—one excelling at memory-bound operations (convolutions), another at compute-bound work (matrix multiplies), a third at reductions. Memory tiling strategies discovered on convolution kernels may transfer to pooling; warp-level primitives learned for reductions may help softmax. This cross-task transfer is why batch optimization outperforms solving each kernel independently.</p>

<section id="conclusion-when-to-reach-for-gepa" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-when-to-reach-for-gepa">Conclusion: When to Reach for GEPA</h2>
<p>We opened with a familiar bind: 50 labeled examples, a prompt that works 70% of the time, and no scalable path forward. GEPA changes that calculus—matching RL’s optimization performance at a fraction of the sample cost by doing something RL can’t: <em>reading the feedback</em>.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves: 46.6% → 56.6% on AIME math competition problems. 67% → 93% on MATH benchmark. CUDA kernels that outperform human-written PyTorch baselines. All achieved through prompt optimization alone, no fine-tuning required.</p>
<p>This represents a genuinely new point in the optimization design space—one that becomes viable as LLMs get better at self-reflection. Where RL needs thousands of trajectories to statistically isolate what went wrong, GEPA reads the compiler error and proposes the fix. That’s not incremental improvement—it’s a 100x reduction in sample requirements.</p>
