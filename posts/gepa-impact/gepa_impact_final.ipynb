So I created a synthetic dataset of 27 sales call transcripts that represented a real challenge we face: **detecting presence of required behaviors and predicting call quality (good/bad)**. The transcripts were hand-labeled across 7 behavior categories `(introduction, needs, value proposition, objection handling, benefit reinforcement, risk reduction, and closing)`. Small enough to iterate fast, realistic enough to validate the approach—and representative of a problem I'd hit repeatedly: intent extraction and call evaluation look easy for a few cases, but precision and recall tank at scale.\n",

    "\n",
    "GEPA (Genetic-Pareto Algorithm) differs from traditional optimization in three key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflective Mutation**: The LLM *reads failure feedback* and proposes targeted improvements. It's not random guessing—it's reasoning about what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pareto Selection**: Instead of keeping only the single best prompt, GEPA maintains a \"frontier\" of diverse specialists. One prompt might excel at detecting objection handling; another at predicting outcomes. This prevents catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text-as-Feedback**: Traditional RL uses scalar rewards. GEPA exploits rich textual feedback (\"You incorrectly marked this as rapport-building because...\") to guide mutations precisely.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Lessons Learned & Recommended Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest lesson wasn't technical, it was psychological. I stopped thinking of prompts as things I *write* and started thinking of them as things I *evolve*. My job shifted from \"craft the perfect prompt\" to \"define what good looks like and let the system find it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to Use GEPA\n",
    "\n",
    "GEPA only works when you can clearly define \"correct.\" If you can't reliably label examples yourself or if the target is fuzzy or subjective, the optimizer will chase noise. I tried it on a sentiment task where human annotators disagreed 30% of the time. The results were inconsistent. **Rule: if you can't do it clearly as a human, don't expect GEPA to figure it out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Recommended Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with a clear metric and a personally-validated dataset.** 20-50 examples you've labeled yourself, understanding the edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run GEPA → Review failures → Add targeted feedback.** Study misclassified examples. Write *specific* explanations of why your label is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run GEPA again → Stop when acceptable → Deploy.** One or two iterations usually suffice. Don't chase perfection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Post-deployment: monitor, collect failures, iterate.** Production surfaces edge cases. Add them with feedback and re-run as needed.\n",
